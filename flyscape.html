                <h3>Terrain</h3>
                <p>Flyscape features procedural mountain terrain, which means that the game generates mountains dynamically and randomly rather than using pre-designed or static landscapes.

The procedural generation algorithm creates mountains of varying shapes, sizes, and elevations, ensuring that players encounter new challenges and obstacles with each session. This dynamic terrain enhances the replayability of Flyscape, providing an ever-changing backdrop for your aerial escapades.</p>
